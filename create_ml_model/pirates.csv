There are no laws by kings or presidents or society out here—only freedom. And he loved freedom. 

“Cap'n, ship off the starboard. French by her flag, I reckon.”

“Let her sail,” Cannonball called. “I'll bet she's just leaving the same port we found this lovely ship at, and she'll be empty.”

“Aye, Cap, where should we sail?”

Cannonball recalled then that freedom also meant another thing. “To adventure, Helmsman McInelly. Let's head south; I have it on good authority from a drunken wench that there be gold on the islands down that way.”

Though a torrent of water seethed around them, El Fantasma's crew were oblivious to it; their eyes could focus only on their captain, who stood in front of an altar at the bow of the ship. Fantasma raised his cutlass, a pitiless weapon made from coral and bone, and brought it down. The captive woman screamed once and then lay still, blood pouring from her stomach and flowing with the rainwater down the deck.

“Great Terrox, come claim your prize,” Fantasma said, his voice the sound of the waves themselves. A groan emanated from beneath the water. For a moment, there was nothing but the sound of rain and the waves. Then a giant tentacle emerged from the deep; slipped around the woman with a wet, sucking sound; and dragged her below the water.

Fantasma called out in a strange and horrible tongue, the words unknown to but a few scholars and even fewer followers of ancient darkness. This time, several tentacles writhed out of the depths to await further instruction. “Tonight,” Fantasma said to his crew, “we hunt.”",,Rise of the Fiends,,,
Pirate,S03,Rare,Story,Blackheart,,,,,,,,"“Now tell me,” Blackheart said, his voice a low growl barely audible above the creaking in the ship's hold. “Tell me where you buried De La Cruz' gold.”

“Never!” Sunderland yelled, not quite believing his own feeble reply.

Blackheart shook his shaggy head, and beneath his grizzled beard cracked a smile like a broken dinner plate. He picked up a small chest and placed it on the barrel next to Sunderland, opening it so that the prone Englishman could see its contents. Blackheart extracted a pair of wicked metal implements with seemingly unnecessary blades and teeth.

“I think ye'll change your mind,” Blackheart said. Sunderland's screams tore through the night, startling the men on watch who looked at each other nervously. Each time the shrieking began again, the helmsman took a drink of rum. An hour later, when Blackheart emerged from the hold, the helmsman could barely stand.

“Here's yer new heading,” Blackheart said, dropping a rough map on the deck, drawn in blood on a torn bandage. “Make for that island as if Hell itself were on yer heels.”",,Rise of the Fiends,,,
American,S04,Rare,Story,Ralph David,,,,,,,,"The bayou's stink rode through New Orleans like a Hessian mercenary, rough and dangerous. A woman tumbled out of an alley stuffing coins into her skirt, and somewhere a fish seller called out his goods. David kept his head down; his clothes marked him as a target, and he wanted to avoid as much unwanted attention as possible. 

His contact was easy to find, a tall Creole man standing at the appointed corner. He recognized David first and whisked him away. “You've brought it, den?” the Creole asked.

“Let's see the ship first,” David said. The Creole led him to a dock behind a warehouse that reeked of preserved fish. She rode high on the water, her cargo hold empty. David counted 20 cannons on her port side alone.

“Satisfied?” the Creole asked. David froze as he felt steel press into his back and a pistol cocking. In a flash, he turned and in one fluid motion knocked the gun from the Creole's hand and sent his boot down on the larger man's suddenly empty fingers, breaking them.

“It's a start,” David said, as he placed a sack of coins in the Creole's broken hand.",,Rise of the Fiends,,,
English,S05,Rare,Story,Thomas Gunn,,,,,,,,"“That age and 'e's made cap'n and given a ship of 'is own?” Stonebottom Mike spat and looked across the deck of the ship at fresh, young, handsome Captain Gunn. 

“I 'eard 'is daddy called in some favors to git him set up nice 'n pretty wit' dis tub,” bald, old John-John said conspiratorially. “S'likely we won't be seein' no action—and no money—on this hitch.” John-John looked up to see Captain Gunn walking over.

“Men!” The two salties snapped to. “We're to set sail in the morning and make our way south. There have been reports of pirates in the area and it's our duty and pleasure to hunt them down in the name of the Crown.” He smiled and looked each man in their bloodshot eyes. “For now, though, see that each man gets an extra ration of rum tonight,” he clasped Stonebottom Mike on the shoulder, “and I wouldn't be too upset if the two of you took a bit more than your share . . . just be ready to sail in the morning.”

Spanish,S06,Rare,Story,Luis Zuan,,,,,,,,"Capitan Luis Zuan was unaccustomed to fancy dinners, but as his legend in the Spanish navy spread he found he was invited to more and more of them. He preferred the feel of a rocking ship beneath him, but he could handle the occasional solidity of a ballroom floor if it meant advancing his career and making a bigger name for himself.

“Capitan Zuan?” A woman's voice broke his thoughts and he turned to see a short but well-proportioned girl, no more than 20, standing in front of him. She wore a beautiful ruffled yellow dress that complemented her form and dark skin perfectly.

“I am,” he responded, stroking his beard. He couldn't help but stare . . . he'd been at sea for so long. “How may I be of service?” 

“You can die!” she said and her eyes burned as she threw her drink in his face. The wine splashed and stained his fine ruffles and ran down his face to drip off his pointed beard. “You and your whole family, especially those damn pirate uncles of yours, can die!” she smashed her now-empty glass on the floor. 

Capitan Zuan turned and walked off, leaving the girl cursing his name behind him. One day, he swore, people would remember his family name for his deeds—not those of his cursed uncles.",,Rise of the Fiends,,,
Pirate,S07,Rare,Story,Calico Cat ,,,,,,,,"The docks stank of rotting fish and worse, but the cool, salty night air felt fresh and clean. Two figures stumbled drunkenly down the dock, taking full advantage of its width.

“That's her!” the man bellowed in a gruff, weathered voice. “That's my girl, the Black Harpy!” he patted the ship moored off to his right. “I took her from Captain Harcourt after he . . . died, and she's been mine ever since.”

“It's very big, sir,” the girl twittered while the big man guffawed.

“That it is,” he said, looking her over again; he'd gotten lucky tonight. “Now, come aboard! We have some business to see to!” As he walked up the plank to the deck, he dismissed two half-sleeping guards and told them to find someplace else to stay the night.

“What's that sound?” the girl asked once she'd stepped aboard.

“That? That's moaning from my ‘passengers' . . . and they'd better shut their damn mouths!” he yelled down into the hold. Silence followed.

“So it's just the two of us here,” the girl stated, but something had changed in her voice. He turned to see her pointing a pistol in his face. “I guess I'll be freeing your ‘passengers' . . . and then before they hang you, you can tell everyone that the Calico Cat took your ship and gave her a proper name. Now if you'll come with me, the Lady's Scorn and I have some work to do.”",,Rise of the Fiends,,,
Cursed,S08,Rare,Story,Hag of Tortuga,,,,,,,,"The serpent had him. The burning coils wrapped around Arnaud's arm slowly and inexorably pulled him away from the wreck, off the reef, toward the depths. Suddenly a howl cut through the crash of the waves. The fiend thrashed as if struck by cannon fire and slipped back beneath the foam-capped sea.

Free! Gasping in relief, Arnaud clutched his maimed arm to his chest—and found himself sprawled at the feet of a haggard woman, dreadlocks hiding all but her gold-flecked eyes in shadow. His storm-battered senses wondered at what fresh terror had found him, until she crouched to stroke his brow with a gentle touch he recognized from his childhood. “Marraine?” he whispered in wonderment.

“You be born under me moon, Julie, brought into my blood,” she said as scabbed hands wet the hem of her ragged dress and wiped it across his brow. “We always be watching our own.” Suddenly her long nails bit into Arnaud's palm. Raising his hand to her face, she tasted his blood, and then spat it into the waves. “Yes . . . now you be owing me, youngling. I getting you back to your shores, but you be certain that blood call for blood one day. Mebbe soon.”",,Rise of the Fiends,,,
French,S09,Rare,Story,Jules Arnaud,,,,,,,,"“A fine report, Jules,” said Mellisar as he poured glasses of brandy. “With the seal of the Royale, the court will no longer be able to dismiss them as ‘ghost stories.' ” Arnaud nodded absently and rubbed the scarred flesh hidden beneath the frilled cuff of his shirt. Every word in the report was true, even the parts he wished he could forget.

He heard the voices of the sea outside the open window, whispers among the waves. During midnight storms, they howled so loudly that he was no longer able to tell the difference between his troubled sleep and his waking nightmare.

On his journeys from island to island he heard hungry chants from the depths. Worse, when he didn't hold himself to the strictest of disciplines, he found himself chanting along, in the tongue the Hag had forced into his mind.

Arnaud had to report what he could to the Crown, for as long as he could. Soon, he feared, the Hag would be calling not to the fiends . . . but for him.",,Rise of the Fiends,,,
Cursed,S10,Rare,Story,Specter,,,,,,,,"Blind Wade knew his mug of ale was empty, but he kept putting it to his lips anyway. Better to do something—anything—rather than sit and wait. The Specter was coming. He could feel it. Soon the glow of her unholy light would sweep the cove looking for anything of value. First the illumination would rouse the curiosity of onlookers, much like the angling lights of deep-sea devil fishes lured in prey. Then, as the undead crew stormed the shore and cannonballs began to scream down, panic would set in. The Cursed would claim their victory; it was inevitable. Even the lone pirate schooner in the cove would be crushed. Prisoners would be “encouraged” to join El Fantasma. Others would be fed to the beasts that followed the Specter's endless trail of blood.

Blind Wade lifted his mug again. He had seen it before. That was the last time he saw anything.

* * * *

The crew of the Specter used to be alive: pirates, rogues, greedy captains of every nation, sailors who couldn't bear to die. Fools all, they pledged their eternal loyalty to El Fantasma. He put the greediest on the Specter and gave them but one purpose: Search the seas and every port for treasure. To ensure they found everything, he infused the Specter with a magical glow, an unholy light that shined brightest when it neared treasure.

Cursed,S01,Common,Story,Sammy the Skull,,,,,,,,"""I request parley with your captain,"" Johann Sussler calmly told the man who held a saber to his throat. Sussler knew how to handle pirates; he had not lost a ship or crew yet.

""Parley!"" the pirate boomed, and Sussler wondered if he saw a flash of barely hidden amusement on his face. The fighting on the ship slowed and eventually stopped, ""Call the captain!""

Sussler noted the poor condition and lack of a flag on the pirate ship. These scum just want some easy gold, and I have maps doctored for such occasions. We'll be heading to port by nightfall, he thought.

""Captain coming aboard!""

The footfalls from the makeshift bridge were slow and deliberate, nearly a shuffle.

What appeared was nothing more than a skeleton-a set of bones in human form wearing the clothes of a long-dead naval captain. Sussler felt bile rise in his throat and had to swallow hard to keep from vomiting all over himself.

The captain held sway over the entire deck. A wave of fear seemed to follow from his glowing yellow eye sockets. Sussler heard his men begin to cry.

A raspy, dry voice of command, starting soft and then becoming louder than it had any right to be, emanated from the fiend's skull. ""Who has requested parley with Admiral Sammy the Skull, naval commander under the great El Fantasma, Lord of the Seas?""

And then Sussler saw the blood red flag of El Fantasma being raised high on the ship, and he knew then that he and his would not live another day.",,Fire and Steel,,,
Pirate,S02,Common,Story,Barstow,,,,,,,,"It chafed Captain Prior to no end that he was being commanded by Lord Mycron himself to make this deal. At least this man was dealing with looked normal; in fact, he looked as if he could be any one of the merchants who plied their trade in Port Royal.

""The package . . . do you have it?"" The scum could actually speak.

""Sir. Do you have it, sir?"" Prior snapped. ""I am a member of the English Royal Navy and I will be addressed as such."" He didn't have to like his job, but the power had its benefits.

""My pardon, sir. I am not used to dealing with men of your caliber.""

Prior handed him the package, a leather satchel that the man opened so quickly Prior thought maybe he hadn't sealed it. The package contained a letter of marque and an English flag. It sickened Prior to see the Union Jack in the hands of scum.

""This will do nicely, Captain Sir,"" the pirate responded excitedly. ""Thank your Lord Mycron and tell him he will not be disappointed with the number of French flags I send to the ocean floor."" Prior snorted and turned to leave the pirate on the docks. The church bells struck midnight.

Barstow watched him walk down the pier and waited until the bells stopped ringing. He had an hour before meeting the French captain. A glorious night like this called for a celebratory spot of rum.",,Fire and Steel,,,
American,S03,Common,Story,Montana Mays,,,,,,,,"""Who are they again?""

""Sir, the governor of Maryland is speaking. Members of Congress are over there. The local politicians are further back. Other members of the president's Cabinet are all sitting by the admiral over there.""

""And all of this is for me? Why?""

""Well, sir, you have become a bit of legend. Reports of your adventures in the Pacific have preceded you here and everyone wants to see the newest admiral.""

As if on cue, Montana heard his name mentioned loudly by the speaker, followed by a round of huzzahs!

""Now what?""

""You need to acknowledge the crowd sir; a wave of the hand is all they ask.""

Standing to face the crowd, Mays waved and sat back down. More cheers rang out and a band began to play a loud and jaunty patriotic song.

""So now back to the ship?""

""No, sir. First you have a lunch thrown by the mayor. Then a reception at the admiral's home. And tonight you will be attending a formal party in your honor at the governor's mansion.""

""Do new admirals actually ever get to sail a ship?""

""Of course, sir, you leave in the morning. You need to be in New York for a reception in two days.""

Mays sighed. ""They said I was getting promoted. I'd hate to see how I'd be punished if I ever did something wrong.""",,Fire and Steel,,,
English,S04,Common,Story,Lord Mycron,,,,,,,,"The HMS Destiny was anchored a safe distance from Port St. Louis.

Lord Mycron sat in the captain's cabin eating what passed for prime rib. Even the turnips were barely edible, which was something of a feat since turnips were at their best merely passable. The wine, taken from the French governor's own cellars, was worth the horrible food.

Lord Mycron poured himself another glass and drank it in one gulp. Parts of Port St. Louis were still aflame, and word was that much of the French fighting force had taken to the jungles outside of town, hoping to hold out until the English left.

But Mycron had thought of that and had a squad of marines at the ready. The Redcoats would ensure that Port St. Louis remained his.

It was a simple thing to start a war. First, a few patriotic speeches for the military. Have them plan out attacks on a few easily captured ports like this one, to make the money men in London happy. Then a quick talk in Parliament about new trade routes and more income for the glory of England. And finally, stroke the Captain's ego by tantalizing them with the ultimate defeat of France - an age-old adversary.

He poured a new glass of wine, pushed away the horrid meal, and grabbed the open document on the table. His first order of business as the new governor of Port St. Louis was to change its name, to Fort Mycron.",,Fire and Steel,,,
English,S05,Common,Story,Hermionie Gold,,,,,,,,"The sound of swords clashing outside Admiral Laurie's quarters was not something new for a warship. It was odd, though, to hear it while docked in Manchester harbor.

The door burst open and a woman rushed in. Laurie knew immediately who it was. ""Cease this now; leave her,"" he commanded. He watched as his guards slowly closed the door behind them, never letting their eyes leave the unkempt woman.

""I want out,"" Hermionie Gold demanded, sword still in hand. ""I never signed up for war.""

She smelled of the sea, the admiral thought, normally a pleasant smell - but not on her. The stench of sulfur from the gunpowder was overwhelming. Her clothes were singed and blood-spattered. Her hair was cropped short and scorched. Her face was caked with grime.

""You never signed up, period. You were assigned,"" Laurie continued. ""Your crimes against the Crown were extensive. Do I need to list them for you? Ship stealing, piracy, pillaging the Crown's ports, murder, vengeance against noble families, blackmail, threats . . .. In fact, I find it odd they didn't just hang you. But lucky for you, somewhere you have a guardian angel. Unlucky for you, you were assigned to me - and I'll use you as I see fit, until the Crown deems your debt satisfied.""

""Or I die trying,"" Gold spat.

""Exactly my hope, my dear. Now back to your ship before I add mutiny to this ever-growing list and have you hung this very day.""",,Fire and Steel,,,
French,S06,Common,Story,Phillipe Jordan,,,,,,,,"""You are joining France's navy at a most glorious time, young capitaine,"" grizzled veteran Michel spoke first. ""You will be a hero and sung about in taverns throughout France, and the choruses will grow louder with each ship you sink."" He raised his goblet in salute.

""True,"" offered Father Ducet, ""and if you happen to die, God bless us all, you will be immortal.""

""Die!"" Phillipe Jordan, already on edge, spat. ""I do not want to die, Father. But it seems even God is laughing at me. This ship is larger than the village I grew up in. I'm the son of a corsair. I am a CORSAIR!"" Jordan slammed his fist down on the table. ""I should not be the captain of a warship. I need one of those faster sloops over there - not a warship.""

""Exactly the reason you are the capitaine."" It was Lenoir who now spoke, softly as if he couldn't trust the walls. ""The English have brought this war to us. They expect - no they know - the kind of response France usually sends: a warship. But, no, this one is led by a daredevil of a corsair, and acts like a corsair's ship. This warship does the unexpected, and by the time the English understand this the scales will tip in France's favor. You, Phillipe Jordan, are the perfect capitaine for the Neptune.""

""Amen,"" replied Father Ducet.",,Fire and Steel,,,
French,S07,Common,Story,Capitaine Arazure,,,,,,,,"""Another report from the Caribbean, sir, about Capitaine Arazure.""

The amiral rubbed his eyes. This war had caused many sleepless nights for him. At all times he had an exact count of the French dead seared into his brain.

But Arazure . . . Arazure was another matter. ""What is it this time?""

""Well, sir, he has sunk another three ships. There is no mention of captives.""

The amiral sighed. ""There would be no captives - Arazure doesn't believe in them.""

The secretary paused. ""There is some mention of French men, whipped and beaten. I assume they were prisoners aboard the English ships.""

""No, no, they were Arazure's crew, I'm sure. Did he kill anyone this time?""

""Sir, are you suggesting Capitaine Arazure is harming his own men?""

""I'm telling you he is. Arazure is nearly insane. He hates the English, which right now makes him valuable to us. But it has become harder and harder to find him crew who can tolerate his mood swings and demands.""

""But, sir, if his is harming his own men, shouldn't he be removed?""

""See that tally there on the board? That is the count of English ships sank by Arazure. Make sure you add in those three ships from your report. When that tally stops increasing, then we will deal with him.""",,Fire and Steel,,,
Spanish,S08,Common,Story,Victor De Alva,,,,,,,,"With his splyglass trained on a spot on the horizon, Victor de Alva watched the battle rage between the two French ships and three English ships. Bored with the action, he turned to his helmsman. 

""Take us south, around the battle; we are not to be seen. Head toward the islands. Either one of them has a port not on our charts, or the fools have decided to fight to the death in the middle of the ocean.""

De Alva knew his history: Spain had gone down the road that leads to war once before, and nearly lost everything. He would not let Spain make the same mistake again.

* * * *

De Alva noted his ship's longitude and latitude in the open journal on his desk, as well as a summary of the battle he had just witnessed.

He then opened his charts and examined the string of islands. Nothing indicated a port at any of them. De Alva put the tip of his finger on the largest island.

""Something is there. I know it,"" he said aloud. He considered the supplies they had on board and the merchant ships ready to sail at his summons. If he were right, within a week Spain would have a fully functioning port in that cove - no matter who claimed it now.

""Let them fight like children,"" thought de Alva, ""while Spain wins the game.""",,Fire and Steel,,,
Pirate,S09,Common,Story,Hammersmith,,,,,,,,"Keeping the rowboat afloat during the squall consumed all the giant man's attention. Hammersmith's arms kept rowing as rain stung his eyes, but it failed to keep him from focusing on the shore of the tiny island.

Proving to be the stronger force of nature, Hammersmith eventually hit the beach and stumbled across the sand to a large rock.

Using his right hand he examined the surface of the rock until he found a crack. Standing with his back to it he walked out 35 paces, and with a shovel that he had carried like a sword, he began to dig.

* * * *

""I don't want to be disturbed,"" were Hammersmith's only words as he carried the great chest to his cabin. This was a private mission. His crew knew not to interfere - or else face the foreboding man's wrath. Hammersmith's gaze lingered at the words HMS Hardcastle, which were exquisitely etched in gold on top of the chest. The words below that, however, looked as though they had been scratched there by a rusty nail: Prison Ship.

The chest was filled with various sacks, but he was concerned with only one: the big one labeled ""Wordly Possessions of Prisoner #5984, Mr. Hammersmith. Not to be opened until received at the Royal Australian Penal Colony.""

Hammersmith opened the sack and a smile broke his haggard face for the first time in a long time.",,Fire and Steel,,,
Cursed,S10,Common,Story,Chum Maker,,,,,,,,"Sammy the Skull's glowing eyes watched as the Chum Maker's large, scythe-like blade was cranked back from her victim's hull: a five-mast ship that was taking on water from the hole the blade had just vacated.

""Captain, sir,"" a voice from behind him quivered. ""Should we board her?""

""No,"" said a voice as dry as the desert. ""Drop the blade again.""

""But, sir. . .""

Sammy turned to the man. His skull face, expressionless as usual, showed nothing, but his voice cut more deeply than the scythe. ""Would you like to join them?"" His boney hand pointed to the screaming crew on the now quite doomed ship.

""N-n-n-n-no, sir. I'll personally see the blade gets dropped again.""

Sammy's attention began to be drawn away from the damned ship to a dark spot forming just under the now-churning sea.

The blade crashed through the ship again, cutting her as if she were no more substantial than a child's toy. The trapped crew began jumping overboard to save themselves, hoping the sea would offer comfort. But Sammy watched as the black spot slowly took shape as tentacles and fins of hundreds of sea creatures boiling just under the surface. He could see them sensing the banquet about to jump unwittingly to their table.
